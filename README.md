# [Secure Random Password Generator](https://corgimaman.github.io/passwordgenerator/)
This is a secure random password generator that uses JavaScript prompts to recieve input from the user on how to randomize the password. The password can generate based on the following options:

* Length (From 8 to 128 characters long)
* Be a mix of:
    * Lowercase letters
    * Uppercase letters
    * Numbers
    * Symbols

The password will copy to the user's clipboard once the password textbox area is clicked.

## What I learned...
In doing this project, I learned how to:
- Use the map function to change the lowercase array to uppercase
- Use JavaScript prompt boxes (parseInt, prompt, alert, confirm)
- Use a JavaScript object
- Use JavaScript functions
- Use empty arrays and strings to be placeholders
- Use the concat function and +=
- Use eventListeners
- Query the DOM
- Use math functions

and just USE JavaScript. Since this was my first time working with it, I learned so much doing this project. Plus, I got to create a very powerful tool.
